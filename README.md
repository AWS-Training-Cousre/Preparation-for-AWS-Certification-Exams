Q: An AWS-using firm has purchased a start-up and wants to move about 100TB data onto AWS within one month. They require a connection to the AWS cloud that is secure, dependable, and private. What is the best option that you would opt for as a [AWS solution architect]?

A: Use Storage Gateway to transfer first data, then set up VPC peering for further transfers.
B: Use Snowball to send the first data and a VPN secure gateway to transfer additional data.
C: Use Snowball for the initial data transfer and Direct Connect for subsequent data transfers.
D: Set up a VPN Cloud Hub connection for data transfer and future relationships.

Option A can be removed from the list of four possibilities since data transmission via Storage Gateway will take over a month to send 100TB of data. Option B and Option C are both viable possibilities. Option D can be deleted because uploading 100TB of data on VPN Cloud Hub would take more than a month. Snowball is the correct answer between options B and C. We must choose between VPN and Direct Connect. Direct Connect often takes longer than a month and, in some cases, up to six months. As a result, we'll go with Option B. This is true for 80% of the questions on the exam. By the way, after six months, Direct Connect may be a better alternative.
